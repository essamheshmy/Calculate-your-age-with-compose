# Calculate-your-age-with-MVVM
Calculate your age is a simple application from a unit screen that contains a button and two text inputs, a unit for the name and a unit for age
This is not a real application where I use things that I do not need to use except for individual holidays
Such as storing the ages of users, using the sold principle, using Java, or even using units of measurement, as this is a small application and will not be developed later.
